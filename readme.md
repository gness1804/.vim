# Vim Files

This is my .vim directory with my customizations. This is currently only set up for Mac.

Many thanks to Luke Maciak's [.vim repo](https://github.com/maciakl/.vim), which contains an example of putting vim config (including .vimrc) under version control. For more details on this, please check out his [informative article on the topic](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/03/12/putting-your-vim-files-under-version-control/).

These above sources should get you up and running when it comes to managing vim configs via Github across multiple machines.
